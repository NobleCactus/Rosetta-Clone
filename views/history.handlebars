	<h1>The History of the Rosetta Stone</h1>
	<h2>Origin and significance</h2>
	<p>The Rosetta Stone is a stone slab with a carving of a decree made in ancient Egypt. The decree is written in
	three languages: 
	<ul>
		<li>Ancient Greek</li>
		<li>Egyptian Heirohlyphic</li>
		<li>Egyptian Demotic</li>	
	</ul> 
	This is significan because it offers a <em>direct</em> translation of Egyptian hieroglyphics, which was a previously
	 lost and undecipherable text. Scholars were able to determine that all three languages were saying the same thing
	 because of their knowledge of Ancient Greek and Egyptian Demotic. Previously untranslatable hierohlyphic texts were
	 now able to be translated as well, which was a boon for any scholar of ancient Egypt.
	</p>

	<h2>Discovery</h2>
	<p>
		The Rosetta Stone was discovered in 1799 by a French soldier who was in Egypt on campaign with Napoleon. It became 
		a very popular discovery, with scholars all over the world studying it and making copies. After the English defeated
		Napoleon, the Rosetta Stone was taken back to England, where it was put into a museum and on display. Despite
		several attempts at getting it back to Egypt, the stone resides in England to this day. Although there have been a
		few similar discoveries since, where the same decree or writing has been found in 2 or 3 languages, the Rosetta Stone 
		was the first.
